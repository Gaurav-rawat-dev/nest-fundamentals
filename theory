CONFIG MODULE : =================================
forRoot() sets up config handling.

It gives you access to ConfigService.

You can use .get() to read variables.

If a variable exists in both .env and terminal, the terminal one is used.

Would you like to see how to use ConfigService in a real service or controller?

Custom env file
ConfigModule.forRoot({
    isGlobal: true,
  envFilePath: '.development.env',
});


❓ Can we use useFactory anywhere in NestJS?
✅ Yes — but only in specific places where NestJS expects a provider or module configuration.
